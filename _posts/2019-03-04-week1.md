## Summary
This week went incredibly well! I was surprised by how well intermittent fasting helped me control my caloric intake and I treated my workout like an appointment I couldn't miss. Overall, a really good week with a few hiccups here and there.

### Highlights
* Lost 3 lbs!
* Stuck to calorie goal every single day (except a single cheat meal)
* Didn't miss a workout
* I retained a lot of the strength I gained last summer

### Lowlights
* Missed an ab workout and only did part of the other
* Didn't finish every move of every workout
* Hurt my back pretty bad unloading weights from a bar on the floor

### My Focus For This Week
1. Finish 100% of my lifting workouts
2. Finish two ab workouts
3. Consistently take creatine daily

## Appendum
### So you're first week went well?
It went so well! I am so happy with how consistent I was able to be. Eating within calorie limits wasn't hard because I could still have big meals by skipping breakfast. I pretty much had dessert every single night and a cheat meal and I still lost 3 lbs! So yeah it was pretty great and I don't feel like I am starving myself.

### How'd your lifting go?
It also went well. I still had a lot of the strength I gained last summer and so lifting just felt really good. There was one day though that I didn't go to work so I had to go in really late to make it up. To make things worse.. it was leg day. But I did it anyway. I finished all of my squats. Although I did every workout, I didn't finish every lift of every workout.

### And Cardio?
Same, did both cardio workouts. I did 10 minutes of HIIT on a stationary bike. The second workout I could already tell my lungs and heart were a little stronger.

### What about Abs?
My core workouts really suffered. I found I ran out of time at the gym after doing my lifting and cardio so I skimped on abs this week.

### You mentioned you hurt your back?
Yeah, I hurt a muscle in my lower back. My wife actually made fun of me because I was hobbling like an old man ofr a day.

### How did you do that?
Someone left a fully loaded barbell on the floor. I bent over it to pull the plates off of it so I could use the bar and when I pulled the bar up with one hand so I could slide the plates one of my back muscles got strained in a weird way. It was really painful and I couldn't bend over quite right after that but I (stupidly) still pushed through my workout since it was upper body. I went home that night and rested my back over the weekend and it is great now.

### What are your plans this week?
Same as last week. I'm going to keep working out and eating within my calorie budget but this week I'm going to focus on finishing every lift of my workouts. Also I'm going to make sure I don't skimp on abs because taking care of your core is really important to your overall strength and balance. Lastly I'm going to take creatine daily. I took it a little bit last week but I'm going to start taking it everyday now. It will help a lot with strength building and ensuring I can do as much weight as possible during my workouts so I don't lose much muscle while I'm cutting down. I also know that taking creatine will cause me to retain more water in my muscles so I may see a bump in my weight from it.
