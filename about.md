**Follow my journey as I take 20 weeks to to revamp my lifestyle, go from fat to fit, and get my health in gear.**

## Who Am I
My name is David. I'm a software engineer in my late 20's living in the Provo, Utah area. I recently graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am married to the most wonderful women who also just so happens to be my best friend. I love reading, coding, and playing video games... in that order.

## My motivation
Shortly after getting married I was diagnosed with a prolactinoma. Basically it is a tumor on your pituitary gland that messes up your hormones all kinds of bad. I don't know how much my tumor has actually contributed to my weight gain but over the course of my courtship and marriage I have gone from 190 lbs to 255 lbs gaining a total of 65 lbs.

As I've met with my doctor he would passive-aggressively tell me to lose weight by leaving a note on my post-visit transcript that read 

> Discussed with patient excessive weight and diet and exercise.

He leaves that note every single time we visit. He never actually mentions it to me though.

I tried quite a few times to lose weight over the last 2 years but I couldn't stick to anything because of the stress from school and working a part-time software engineering job. 

Now that I am out of school and life has calmed down I have a chance to build a new lifestyle as a working professional. After some reflection and study I have started to discover the lifestyle that I want to try and build. The start of that lifestyle, at least for me, is going to be physical fitness. This lifestyle encompasses more than just physical fitness but the purpose of this blog is to motivate me in that aspect.

Why 20 weeks? Simply put, I have 20 weeks until my next appointment with my doctor and I want to make a significant improvement in my physical health by then. In other words, I want to avoid the passive aggressive notes on my post-visit transcript.

Of course there is more to my motivation than just avoiding my doctor's disapproval. I have had quite a few wake up calls which you can read about in my first blog post. I also want to be healthy for all the same reasons most people do: I want to better myself and stand out among my peers, coworkers, and family as one who can do hard things and overcome challenges. I want to be healthy and strong and live a good life. I want to have greater confidence in myself. Most of all I want to prove to myself that *I* can do it.

## My Goals
So what are my specific goals? During the next 20 weeks I will
* Lose 30-40 lbs
* Prioritize fitness in my life by not missing a single workout
* Stick to my new eating habits every single one of the 20 weeks.

## How I'm Going to Do It
My plan is simple and most of it comes from Mike Matthew's book *Bigger Leaner Stronger*, with a few small tweaks. It's going to involve eating at a calorie deficit to lose weight while also lifting heavy weights and eating a high protein diet to prevent muscle loss.

### Diet
1. Stick to a calorie deficit
   Starting out this is going to be 1800 calories a day and I will adjust as needed. No foods are off limits, just have to be under.
2. Incorporate intermittent fasting to help control my eating behaviors and handle insulin insensitivity
   I have already started to do this in the last few days and it has not been hard to do. I naturally don't really want breakfast in the morning anyway so this is a great way to help me control my calorie intake.
3. Eat enough protein to maintain/build muscle mass
   This will probably be the hardest part for me because cooking is hard, meat is expensive, and protein powders are not for satiating given how many calories I am giving up to drink them. But I'm going to do it. I'm going to commit.
4. A single cheat meal each week where I don't track calories, just to keep my sanity

To help me stick to my diet I am going to be preparing all of my lunches for each week the weekend before (goodbye free catering.) My wife has agreed to help with cooking dinner in the evening so that we aren't tempted to eat out.

### Weight Lifting
For my weight lifting routine I'm going to be following Mike Matthew's *The Year One Challenge* on a five day split. I actually finished a couple of phases of Mike's program last summer and saw great gains in my strength and muscle mass. I'm going to be starting from the beginning though and I am going to continue through the whole year of workouts even after this 20 week challenge is over.

I'm scheduling my workouts in everyday at 4:00pm. It's literally a meeting on my calendar so that no one can schedule me for anything else. I'm going to be working out at the gym at my work and I'm not going to let myself go home if I haven't finished my workout. I have a co-worker who is going to be lifting with me when he can which will also help with motivation.

### Cardio
I'm going to do 2 sessions of HIIT each week. I will perform them on Monday and Wednesday right after finishing my lifting workouts. I'm going to start with 10 minute sessions and increase the time by 1 minute each week so that by my last week I am doing 30 minute HIIT sessions.

## If I can do it, so can you!
I am just a normal guy who has struggled with his weight for years, but I am proving to myself that I can overcome that. I hope that you will join me on my fitness journey. By reading this blog you are helping me on mine, you are giving me a little more motivation to finish because I don't want to let you down. But I also hope that by writing this blog that I am helping you. That you can be inspired, see what works and what doesn't, learn from my mistakes, and most of all that you will be inspired to prove to yourself that you can do it too.
